Version 0.11
============

	Third official release

Meteodata-server now supports getting archives from weatherlink.com for stations
with a IP datalogger and getting realtime data if the last archive is too old
and the Weatherlink v1 API token is available. Meteodata-server also fetches
SYNOP messages from Ogimet for MétéoFrance stations. The database scheme as
changed: there are two new tables for respectively the daily and monthly
climatology, and the primary key of the observation table is now the pair
(Station UUID, day) in order to avoid unbounded row growth. For now, we use the
two schemes. When the migration is over, there will be some cleanup to do.

version 0.7
===========

Meteodata-server now supports detecting the station timezone, adjusting the
clock and retrieving the station's archives when the station has been
disconnected for too long.
