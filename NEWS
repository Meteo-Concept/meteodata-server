Version 0.16
============

	Fifth official release

Now that Davis makes data from Weatherlink IP (and Vantage Connect, etc.)
available via their API v2, we can get the data from there. Progressively,
it will be feasible to phase out API v1 but since the pricing is very different
many customers will likely prefer to keep the archive for free (which the
API v1 allows).

Version 0.14
============

	Fourth official release

Meteodata-server now supports getting realtime data and archives from the
(yet-to-be-officially-released) WeatherLink API v2. WeatherLink Live stations
are only available through this API. Binaries have been added to bulk download
data from weatherlink.com, either via the old API or the v2 one.
The old Cassandra database is no longer getting new data. Only the new schema
is now used.

Version 0.11
============

	Third official release

Meteodata-server now supports getting archives from weatherlink.com for stations
with a IP datalogger and getting realtime data if the last archive is too old
and the Weatherlink v1 API token is available. Meteodata-server also fetches
SYNOP messages from Ogimet for MétéoFrance stations. The database scheme as
changed: there are two new tables for respectively the daily and monthly
climatology, and the primary key of the observation table is now the pair
(Station UUID, day) in order to avoid unbounded row growth. For now, we use the
two schemes. When the migration is over, there will be some cleanup to do.

version 0.7
===========

	Second official release

Meteodata-server now supports detecting the station timezone, adjusting the
clock and retrieving the station's archives when the station has been
disconnected for too long.

version 0.1

	First official release
